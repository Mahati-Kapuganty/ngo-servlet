                <h2>Republic day, Deepgriha orphanage</h2><img src="deepgriha1.jpg" />
                <p>It has been 74 years since we have celebrated Republic Day, but most of us have a limited understanding of its significance. Such information, if taught to children from an early age, can help them understand better. As a result, on this Republic Day, the ACT volunteers performed a skit for orphanage children in order for them to gain a better understanding of such topics.</p>

                <h2>Health check up camp, Uruli</h2><img src="uruli2.jpg">
                <p>On this Independence Day we  wanted our loved ones, the people we know and also the people we don't know to be physically as well as mentally fit. In our busy lives we don't take of ourselves so we decided to organise a health camp and yes it was a success because of everyone's effort.</p>

                <h2>Blood donation drive, Yavat</h2><img src="yavat1.jpg">
                <p>Many women and men participated in this program, women understood the importance of blood donation, misconceptions were gradually decreasing, women started telling that they want to donate blood. Gynecologists Dr. Gauri Jagdale, Rahu and Dr. Rajshri Dongarwal gave health information and free guidance to the women. Pune blood bank, Sonawane Sir, Jayesh Sir and his team gave very good support .</p>
